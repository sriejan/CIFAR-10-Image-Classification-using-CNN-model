# Deep-Learning-using-Cifar-10
Deep Learning concepts practice using Cifar-10 dataset

Topics Covered in this project:
- Build a deep neural network model
- Add "he_normal" as kernel initializer and evaluate the model
- Apply some Nonsaturating Activation Functions : ReLU, LeakyReLU, ReLU, PReLU, ELU, SELU
- Add "lecun_normal" normalization with SELU
- Learning Rate Schedulers : Cyclic Learning rate and also check the accuracy and loss

<b>All the implementation are done in TensorFlow and Keras</b>
